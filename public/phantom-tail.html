        <i>Phantom Tail</i> investigates the concept of an extra limb—specifically, 
        a phantom tail—as an extension of the human body. Inspired by the 
        phenomenon of phantom limbs, the work explores how the brain maps 
        the body and adapts to new or lost appendages. Phantom limb sensations 
        occur when individuals continue to feel an amputated limb, often due 
        to the brain's persistent cortical representation of the missing body 
        part. This suggests that our sense of body is not fixed but shaped by 
        experience and adaptation.

      <p class="main-text">
        Taking an evolutionary perspective, the work  expands on the possibility 
        of a phantom tail—an ancestral remnant embedded in our neurological 
        history. For over 500 million years, our ancestors used tails for balance 
        and movement, but around 25 million years ago, a genetic mutation led to 
        their disappearance in humans. Given the brain’s capacity to retain sensory
        maps, could it still hold traces of this lost limb? The human embryo even 
        briefly develops a tail-like structure, hinting at our deep biological 
        connection to this forgotten appendage.

        Beyond the physical, <i>Phantom Tail</i> also draws from Donna Haraway’s ideas 
        in <i>The Companion Species Manifesto</i>, which challenges the human-centered 
        worldview. Haraway argues that species should not be defined by separation 
        but by relationships, advocating for a more responsible coexistence with 
        non-human life. In this context, the phantom tail becomes more than a 
        sensory extension—it symbolizes a call for reconnection with other species 
        and the environment. The work explores the notion of the phantom tail 
        as both a speculative prosthetic and a conceptual bridge between the human 
        body, evolutionary memory, and the ecological relationships that shape our 
        existence.
